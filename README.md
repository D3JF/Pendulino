# Pendulino
A simple pendulum cart physics simulator made in C++ and the SFML graphics library.

## How to run
Compile using any C++ compiler of your choice with the appropriate SFML libraries linked during compilation. You may tweak the initial constant in code and see how the simulation reacts. My goal was to add graphical sliders to modify them on-the-fly, unfortunately I have not implemented that yet.
